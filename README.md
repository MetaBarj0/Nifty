# Nifty - Advanced NFT Smart Contract Suite

A comprehensive, NFT implementation featuring crowdsale mechanics, upgradeable
architecture, and extensive functionality built on Ethereum.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Core NFT Implementation (`Nifty.sol`)

- **Full ERC721 Compliance**: Complete implementation of the ERC721 standard with metadata and enumerable extensions
- **Advanced Minting**: Flexible minting system with controlled supply management  
- **Burnable Tokens**: Secure token burning functionality with proper event emission
- **Pausable Operations**: Emergency pause functionality for security and maintenance
- **Revealable Metadata**: Support for hidden/revealed NFT mechanics common in modern drops
- **2-Step Ownership**: Enhanced ownership transfer security using OpenZeppelin's 2-step pattern
- **ERC165 Introspection**: Full interface detection support for maximum compatibility
- **Basic Permit feature**: non typed permit implementation. Kept simple for demonstration purpose

### Crowdsale System (`Crowdsale.sol`)

- **Flexible Sale Mechanics**: Configurable pricing, timing, and allocation limits
- **Multi-phase Sales**: Support for different sale phases with varying conditions
- **Whitelist Support**: Built-in allowlist functionality for exclusive access
- **Payment Processing**: Secure ETH handling with withdrawal mechanisms
- **Supply Management**: Automatic tracking and enforcement of mint limits
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event system for transparency and indexing

### Upgradeable Architecture

- **Transparent Proxy Pattern**: Implementation of OpenZeppelin's transparent upgradeable proxy
- **Secure Upgrades**: Admin-controlled upgrade mechanism with role separation
- **Storage Safety**: Careful storage layout management to prevent upgrade conflicts
- **Initialization Support**: Proper initialization patterns for proxy deployments

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

The project maintains **100% test coverage** across all critical components:

- **15 comprehensive test suites** covering every contract function
- **100% line coverage** on core contracts (Nifty.sol: 151/151 lines, Crowdsale.sol: 58/58 lines)
- **100% branch coverage** ensuring all conditional paths are tested  
- **100% function coverage** validating every public/external function
- **Edge case testing** including overflow, underflow, and boundary conditions
- **Access control testing** verifying proper permission management
- **Integration tests** ensuring contracts work together seamlessly

### Test Categories

- ERC721 compliance tests
- Minting and burning functionality
- Crowdsale mechanics and edge cases
- Proxy upgrade scenarios
- Access control and permissions
- Pausable functionality
